## [restdns](https://github.com/suu-g/restdns)
An HTTP server, which provides DNS request via REST interface.
This is especially useful for restricted environments which you
can't send DNS request by yourself, such like Google App Engine, 
Browser Extensions (writtern in Javascript), and so on.

It was first created at 2010, has nothing to do with the 
[DNS Looking Glass](http://www.bortzmeyer.org/dns-lg.html) Project,
though, I'd love to be in part of it.

## [infoget](https://github.com/suu-g/infoget)
Code snippets for getting information about host and process.

## subot
Code snippet running server. Under construction now.
